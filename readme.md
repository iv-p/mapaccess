# mapaccess

A small golang library to retrieve arbitrary keys from golang interface{}. Think of it as acessing JSON keys from arbitrary object. It is heavily influenced by the golang temlpate engine.

## Installation

To install mapaccess just run the following command in your terminal
```
go get -u github.com/iv-p/mapaccess
```

## Ideology

The library consists of three different components - lexer, parser and interpreter. They work concurrently, making mapaccess very fast.

## Example

mapaccess exposes only one function, which takes a string key and a interface{}:
```go
result, err := mapaccess.Get("key.one[0].two", data)
```
The key should represent a JSON type location of the data in the interface{}. It is intended to work only with basic interfaces - only map[string]interface{} and []interface{}, it won't work if you pass arbitrary structure.

It is intended towards using with serializing arbitary JSON and getting an arbitrary key out of it like so:
```go
j := []byte(`{
    "id": "9b92b11b-b57f-4fa6-af5e-e35a290dc764",	
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 44,
    "friends": [
        {
            "name": "Jaime Mckinney",
            "age": 41
        },
        {
            "name": "Evangeline Alvarado"
        },
        {
            "name": "Beth Cantrell"
        }
    ]
}`)
var deserialised interface{}
err := json.Unmarshal(j, &deserialised)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

bestFriendName, err := mapaccess.Get(deserialised, "friends[0].name")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

myName, err := mapaccess.Get(deserialised, "name")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

log.Printf("My name is %s and my best friend's name is %s",
    myName, bestFriendName)
```

Running the above snippet produces the following output
```
My name is John Doe and my best friend's name is Jaime Mckinney
```

## Syntax
### Keys
A key can be accessed either as the root, or as a nested field. If after a nested field, it's required it's after a `.`
```go
// Valid
mapaccess.Get(data, "friends")
mapaccess.Get(data, "friends.name")
mapaccess.Get(data, "friends[0].name")
// Invalid
mapaccess.Get(data, "friends[0]name")
```
### Array indexes
An array index can be accessed the same as a regular key, either at the root level, or at a deeper level. The only difference is that nested array indexes need to be consecutive `key[0][1]` and can't be separated by a `.`. At root level, no `key` identifier is expected before the array index, however if it's nested a `key` identifier is always required.
```go
// Valid
mapaccess.Get(data, "[0]")
mapaccess.Get(data, "friends[0]")
mapaccess.Get(data, "friends[0][1]")
mapaccess.Get(data, "friends[0][1].name")
// Invalid
mapaccess.Get(data, "[0].[1]")
mapaccess.Get(data, "friends[0].[1]")
```

### Generic GetAs[T any] Method
The `GetAs[T any]` method allows you too simplify accessing maps by casting the extraced value to a concrete type
```go
// Valid
mapaccess.GetAs[string](data, "id")
mapaccess.GetAs[string](data, "name")
mapaccess.GetAs[int](data, "age")
mapaccess.GetAs[string](data, "friends[0].name")
mapaccess.GetAs[int](data, "friends[0].age")
```

## Valid keys

There is a limitation of the alphabet for keys, it includes underscores, dashes and alphanumeric characters.
